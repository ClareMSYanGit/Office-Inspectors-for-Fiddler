# MAPI Inspector for Fiddler
The Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) Inspector for [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) decodes the MAPI message payload of an HTTP POST request and response. The MAPI Inspector displays under the *Inspectors* tab in Fiddler.

This repository also includes Jscript that adds an *MS Protocol* column in the Fiddler web session panel. The *MS Protocol* column displays the protocols that are relevant to MAPI messages thereby allowing you to easily identify which HTTP requests and responses contain MAPI message payloads.

The MAPI inspector decodes the MAPI message payload according to [MS-OXCMAPIHTTP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dn530952(v=EXCHG.80).aspx). This *Readme* document provides instructions for installing the MAPI Inspector. For details about how to use the MAPI Inspector, see the [*MAPI Inspector for Fiddler User Guide*](https://github.com/OfficeDev/MAPI-Inspector-for-Fiddler/wiki) wiki page *.

## Installation 
Installation of the MAPI Inspector involves adding the DLL file and the MAPI script. Before installing these items, you must first install the latest [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) tool and then run it. Note that Fiddler must be run at least once before installing the MAPI Inspector.
